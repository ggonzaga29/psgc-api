# PSGC API

This project is an REST API implementation of the [The Philippine Standard Geographic Code](https://psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc/).

The Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) is a systematic classification and coding of geographic areas of the Philippines.

It is based on the four well-established hierarchical levels of geographical-political subdivisions of the country such as the administrative region, the province, the municipality/city and the barangay.
